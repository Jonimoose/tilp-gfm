Here is a quick guide how to get Code Blocks to compile. It will be better in the future.

1. Open up the Project
2. Project -> Build Options -> GFM -> Compiler -> Other Options
   Set these to the corrosponding settings on your machine.
3. Click #defines tab:
   change __LINUX to either __LINUX__, __WIN32__ or __BSD__ (depending on your system)
4. Change SHARE_DIR to where ever your icons, pixmaps, help, glade directories are.
5. Click on Linker, set to the settings to your machine.

6. You should be good to go (on Linux atleast :P).
