NAME
       TiLP - a communication program for TI calculators ('Ti Linking Program'
       or 'Tilp is a Linking Program')

SYNOPSYS
       tilp-2 [--help] [--version] [-h] [-v] [--calc=] [--cable=]  [--port=  ]
       [--timeout=] [--delay=] [--no-gui] [filename]

DESCRIPTION
       The TiLP program allows you to backup, restore and archive variables of
       your Texas Intruments calculator on your computer. It  has  also  addi-
       tional  features  such as screen dump, remote control, ROM dump, FLASH-
       ing. TiLP is a very complete program. Moreover, you have the same  pro-
       gram for all calculator types.

OPTIONS
       The  command  line  of  tilp-2 can be used for sending or opening files
       (variables, backup, FLASH apps, OS, ...). For sending one or more file,
       simply  pass  the  filename(s)  on  the  command line with the -cmdline
       option. If you don't use the -cmdline option, the  file  will  be  open
       within the GUI by the Group File Manager.

       It  is  possible  to send one or more files (single/group file only) or
       one file which can be a single/group var as well as a backup,  a  FLASH
       app  or  an Operating System even. You can not do any other operations.
       If  you  want  more  operations,  you  can  use  the  interactive  mode
       (-gui=console).     Example:    tilp-2    --cable=BlackLink    --port=1
       --calc=ti92+ romdump.9xz

       Note: options must be passed before the filename !

       tilp accepts the following options:

       -h, --help
              Display a list of all command line options.

       -v, --version
              Output the version info.

       --no-gui
              Send file(s)  without  launching  any  Graphic  User  Interface.
              Informations  are  displayed in the console.  Beware: using this
              switch disables any overwrite check. Use it with care!

       --calc=
              Select a calculator type: v200, ti92+, ti92, ti89t, ti89,  ti86,
              ti85, ti84+, ti83+, ti83, ti82 or ti73.

       --cable=
              Select  a link cable type (case sensitive): GrayLink, BlackLink,
              Parallel, SilverLink, DirectLink, VTi, TiEmu.

       --port=
              Specify on which port the link cable is plugged on. Can be null,
              1, 2, 3 or 4.

       --timeout=
              in  tenth of seconds (0.1 s). This is the time while the program
              wait a response of the calculator. Once this delay elapsed,  the
              program send a time out error. The default value is 1 seconds.

       --delay=
              in  microseconds.  This is the time which separate the transmis-
              sion of 2 bytes.  The default value is 5 microseconds.  Decrease
              this  value  increase the transfer speed but decrease the relia-
              bility of the transmission.

EXAMPLE
       Quicly send (no gui) an TI89 file with a BlackLink cable on the  second
       serial port (/dev/ttyS1 or COM2); timeout is set to 2s:

       tilp-2  --calc=ti89  --cable=BlackLink  --port=2  --timeout=20 --no-gui
       group.89g

CONFIG FILE FORMAT
       This  section describes the format of the .tilp config file which is in
       the home directory of the user (Linux) or the  tilp.ini  file  (Win32).
       The  file  is  separated  into  several  sections (hardware, gui, calc,
       external programs, fonts, screen, misc). But, there is  no  order,  you
       can  write  lines  as you want.  A line preceded by the '#' symbol is a
       comment. Each line has the following format:  option=something.   Every
       line  can  be  put  in any order. Beware: any comment added to the file
       will be overwritten !  Below is described each option and the  possible
       values:

       version=  Which  version  of  TiLP has written the config file. Used to
