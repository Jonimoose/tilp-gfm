.SH NAME
TiLP - a communication program for TI calculators ('Ti Linking Program' or 'Tilp is a Linking Program')
.SH SYNOPSYS
\fBtilp-2\fP [--help] [--version] [-h] [-v] [--calc=] [--cable=] [--port= ] [--timeout=] [--delay=] [--no-gui] [filename]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBTiLP\fP program allows you to backup, restore and archive variables of your Texas Intruments calculator on your computer. It has also additional features such as screen dump, remote control, ROM dump, FLASHing. TiLP is a very complete program. Moreover, you have the same program for all calculator types.
.SH OPTIONS
The command line of tilp-2 can be used for sending or opening files (variables, backup, FLASH apps, OS, ...). For sending one or more file, simply pass the filename(s) on the command line with the \fB-cmdline\fP option. If you don't use the \fB-cmdline\fP option, the file will be open within the GUI by the Group File Manager.

It is possible to send one or more files (single/group file only) or one file which can be a single/group var as well as a backup, a FLASH app or an Operating System even. You can not do any other operations. If you want more operations, you can use the interactive mode (\fB-gui=console\fP).
Example: tilp-2 --cable=BlackLink --port=1 --calc=ti92+ romdump.9xz

Note: options must be passed before the filename !

\fBtilp\fP accepts the following options:
.TP
\fB-h, --help\fP
Display a list of all command line options.
.TP
\fB-v, --version\fP
Output the version info.
.TP
\fB--no-gui\fP
Send file(s) without launching any Graphic User Interface. Informations are displayed in the console.
Beware: using this switch disables any overwrite check. Use it with care!
.TP
\fB--calc=\fP
Select a calculator type: v200, ti92+, ti92, ti89t, ti89, ti86, ti85, ti84+, ti83+, ti83, ti82 or ti73.
.TP
\fB--cable=\fP
Select a link cable type (case sensitive): GrayLink, BlackLink, Parallel, SilverLink, DirectLink, VTi, TiEmu.
.TP
\fB--port=\fP
Specify on which port the link cable is plugged on. Can be null, 1, 2, 3 or 4.
.TP
\fB--timeout=\fP
in tenth of seconds (0.1 s). This is the time while the program wait a response of the 
calculator. Once this delay elapsed, the program send a time out error. The 
default value is 1 seconds.
.TP
\fB--delay=\fP
in microseconds. This is the time which separate the transmission of 2 bytes.
The default value is 5 microseconds. Decrease this value increase the 
transfer speed but decrease the reliability of the transmission.
.SH EXAMPLE
Quicly send (no gui) an TI89 file with a BlackLink cable on the second serial port (/dev/ttyS1 or COM2); timeout is set to 2s:
.TP
tilp-2 --calc=ti89 --cable=BlackLink --port=2 --timeout=20 --no-gui group.89g
.SH CONFIG FILE FORMAT
This section describes the format of the .tilp config file which is in the home directory of the user (Linux) or the tilp.ini file (Win32). The file is separated into several sections (hardware, gui, calc, external programs, fonts, screen, misc). But, there is no order, you can write lines as you want.
A line preceded by the '#' symbol is a comment. Each line has the following format: option=something.
Every line can be put in any order. Beware: any comment added to the file will be overwritten !
Below is described each option and the possible values:

\fBversion=\fP
Which version of TiLP has written the config file. Used to display the Release the file and to keep compatibility.

\fBcalc_model=\fP
Defines the calculator type. Choose one of the following value (case sensitive): ti82, ti83, ti83+, ti85, ti86, ti89, ti92, ti92+, v200.

\fBcable_model=\fP
Define the link cable type (case sensitive). Choose one of the following value: GrayLink, BlackLink, Parallel, SilverLink, DirectLink, VTi or TiEmu.

\fBcable_port=\fP
Define the port to use. You have to choose one of the following value depending on your link cable type and the port you want use: parallel port #[1-3], serial port #[1-4], virtual port #[1-2], USB port #[1-4].

\fBcable_timeout=\fP
with the timeout value to use in tenth of seconds. Default value: 20.

\fBcable_delay=\fP
with the delay value to use in micro-seconds for home-made cables. Default value: 10

\fBpane_x_size=\fP and \fBpane_y_size=\fP
Gives the width and height values of the remote view.

\fBwnd_x_size1=\fP and \fBwnd_y_size1=\fP
Gives the width and height of the windows in full view.

\fBwnd_x_size2=\fP and \fBwnd_y_size2=\fP
Gives the width and height of the windows in simplified view (no right frame).

\fBlocal_sort=\fP
Define the sorting method for the right window. Choose one of the following value: name, date, size, user, group, attrib

\fBlocal_sort_order=\fP
Define the sorting order for the right window. Choose either 'up' or 'down'.

\fBremote_sort=\fP
Define the sorting method for the left window. Choose one of the following value: name, info, type, size

\fBremote_sort_order=\fP
Define the sorting order for the left window. Choose either 'up' or 'down'.
