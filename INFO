Welcome to GFM! This Program is currently NOT in working condition.

There is many things todo:
-create a configure script system with the AutoHell Tools so I can work on it!.
-Please comment everything very well! Messy coders will be shot on site!
-The Stuff below, also located near the top of src/main.c:

/* Todo List: - Leave, its easy to access in Dev-C++
   Computer (Folder) Tree:
   -dragging (folder_drag.c/h)
     -Group File into the Group Tree and opens Group File
     -TI File onto TI File in FOlder Tree to merge into Group File
   -Enter Key on selection in folder tree to open file in Group Tree.
   -Complete the Right Click Menu Items (I will get these)
   -Current Folder Label, folders can get long, and they move the slider, so lets cut them with "..." in the middle ;)
   -All GUI Callback functions for tree in gui.c
   
   Group File Tree:
   -Init (program in group_tree.c, gtree_sort.c, [group_tree.h]) and call in gui.c where folder
    tree is called (~line 72)
   -Dragging (group_drag.c/h)
     -File onto Folder Tree to extract
     -File onto TI File in Folder Tree to merge/create Group File
     -File from Folder Tree into Group Tree to add to Group File
   -Sorting (code in gtree_sort.c) and implement
   -Right Click to open that menu and get items coded (in menu.c,menu.h [maybe have two files for different tree menus]      would be fine I think)
   -Update Labels under Group Tree (Groupfile Size, Num of files in group)
    (pointers to labels in gfm_widget in gui.h struct)
   -Double Click (Rename Group File)
   
   Other:
   -Buttons at top of Program (New, MkDir, Refresh, Delete || Add, Rename, Delete, Refresh, Help)
    all need coded (nothing done for) callback functions in gui.c
   -input dialog in dialogs.glade needs to be implemented into dialog.c/h
   -progress bars need to be done in pbar.c/.h
   -man page dialog needs to be implemented
   -html launcher needs to be done
   -Changelog/Release Dialog (like on on first time TiLP is booted)
   -Options Dialog (options.c/h) (I have the config file handled in config.c/h)
   -More Settings, Main Window Size + Slider Position @ boot
   
   Notes:
   -file filtering in folder tree?? check the compat part...
