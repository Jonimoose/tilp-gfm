Welcome to GFM! This Program is currently NOT in complete working condition.

There is many things todo:
-Please comment everything very well! Messy coders will be shot on site!
-The Stuff below, also located near the top of src/main.c:

Computer (Folder) Tree:
   -dragging (folder_drag.c/h)
     -Group File into the Group Tree and opens Group File
     -TI File onto TI File in FOlder Tree to merge into Group File
   -Enter Key on selection in folder tree to open file in Group Tree.
   -Group/Ungroup Selection in Folder Tree Right Click Menu
   -The Rest of GUI Callback functions for tree in gui.c (if any)

   Group File Tree:
   -Init (program in group_tree.c, gtree_sort.c, [group_tree.h]) and call in gui.c where folder
    tree is called (~line 72)
   -Dragging (group_drag.c/h)
     -File onto Folder Tree to extract
     -File onto TI File in Folder Tree to merge/create Group File
     -File from Folder Tree into Group Tree to add to Group File
   -Sorting (code in gtree_sort.c) and implement
   -Right Click to open that menu and get items coded (in gtree_menu.c,gtree_menu.h)
    (pointers to labels in gfm_widget in gui.h struct)
   -Double Click (Rename Group File)

   Other:
   -Buttons at top of Program (New, MkDir, Refresh, Delete || Add, Rename, Delete, Refresh, Help)
    all need coded - callback functions in gui.c
   -progress bars need to be done in pbar.c/.h
   -man page dialog needs to be implemented
   -html launcher needs to be done
   -Changelog/Release Dialog (like on on first time TiLP is booted)
   -Load Settings at boot, size of Main Window, and where slider is
   -Make a routine just for loading glade xml, we have many copies within GFM.

   Notes:
   -file filtering in folder tree?? check the compat part...
